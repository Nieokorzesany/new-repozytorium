      <h3>Sum 41 - Motivation</h3>
      <p>
        What's the difference of never knowing at all? 
When every step I take is always too small. 
Maybe it's just something I can't admit but lately, 
I feel like I don't give a shit. 

Motivation such an aggravation, 
Accusations don't know how to take them. 
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it. 
Concentration's never hard to break it. 
Situation never what you want it to be. 

What's the point of never making mistakes? 
Self-indulgence is such a hard habit to break. 
It's all just a waste of time in the end. 
Don't care, so why should I even pretend? 

Motivation such an aggravation, 
Accusations don't know how to take them. 
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it. 
Concentration's never hard to break it. 
Situation never what you want it. 

Nothing's new, everything's the same. 
It keeps on dragging me down, it's getting kind of lame. 
I'm falling further behind, there's nothing to explain. 
No matter what you say nothing's gonna change my mind. 

Can't depend on doubt until the end. 
It seems like leaving friends has become 
This years trend and though I can't pretend. 
It's fine to be mislead. 
It's not the same but who's to blame, 
For all those stupid things I never said. 

Motivation such an aggravation, 
Accusations don't know how to take them. 
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it. 
Concentration's never hard to break it. 

Motivation such an aggravation, 
Accusations don't know how to take them. 
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it. 
Concentration, 
Situation never what you want it to be. 

Never what you want it to be. 
Never what you want it to be

      <h3>Sum 41 - Heart Attack</h3>
      <p>
        Remember when there was nothing else to do, but lie in bed and, 
wonder how it was always up to you, and no one else and, 
Early mornings, plagued by warnings, what's the point of the alarm that I'm ignoring? 
It's even raining, I'm not complaining, but waking up is hard to do so, 

[Chorus:] 
Turn my head its back to bed with no delay, 
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times a day, 
Why get up when morning doesn't even start till two? 
Forget reality waking up is hard to do. 

Remember when we would hang out every day, and we would rather, 
Not be told what to do or what to say, cause nothing mattered. 
Never boring, slept in mornings, not ashamed of the habits that I'm forming. 
Its not important if days are shortened, I can't make time when nothings new, 
Cause waking up is hard to do so, 

[Chorus] 

What's a day when it all ends up the same, and lasts forever? 
Can't complain when there's nothing there to blame, and things can't be better. 
Summer evenings, teenage grievings, got no problem with the life that I've been leading. 
No concentration on hesitation, I can't make time when nothings new, 
Cause waking up is hard to do so!

      <h3>Paragraf nr 3</h3>
      <p>
        Torem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
        since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
        centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially unchanged.
